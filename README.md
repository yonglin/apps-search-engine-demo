apps-search-engine-demo
=======================

This is a toy python program for searching applications you want

There are two interaction programs you can run.

The fist is interaction.py, if you run this python file in the 
linux terminal"python interaction.py", it will automatically crawls the
47 * 48 = 2256 apps' descriptions. This will take a little bit time

The another choic is to run interaction_picke.py.
since I have stored the crawled data in the file raw.data, it will be much faster
